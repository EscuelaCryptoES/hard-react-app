# Hardhat React App from EscuelaCryptoES

This repository contains a forked Hardhat project that is a sample project that 
you can use as the starting point for your Ethereum project. 
It's also a great fit for learning the basics of smart contract development.

## Quick start

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EscuelaCryptoES/hard-react-app.git
cd hard-react-app
npm install
```

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm install web3
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.

## Whatâ€™s Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a Dapp powered by Hardhat and React.
